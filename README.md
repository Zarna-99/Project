Customer churn is a major concern for organizations, as losing existing customers is something no company wants to experience. Therefore, it's crucial to analyze patterns of customer churn and develop strategies to address this issue. To prevent customer attrition, it's important to identify which customers are likely to remain loyal and which are at risk of leaving the company. This enables organizations to focus their efforts on retaining those customers who are most likely to leave. To achieve this, organizations often employ machine learning models to make accurate predictions about customer behavior.


This GitHub repository utilizes a dataset containing customer information from a telecommunications company. This notebook is dedicated to performing exploratory data analysis and building models based on seven different algorithms. Once the models are created, they are evaluated based on their respective metrics, with the best model ultimately being selected. After analyzing the dataset, the Light Gradient Boosting algorithm was found to provide the best results, which is why the final model was built using this particular algorithm.
